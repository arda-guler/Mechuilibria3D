# Mechuilibria3D
A simple structural analysis tool as well as a physics sandbox. Design 3D structures out of beams and simulate their dynamic behavior under internal and external forces.

See how the beams get under tension and compression under various loads, add more beams if required or change your connection points accordingly to best fit your design criteria. Apply external forces and see how many free movement axes your structure has - if any.

More documentation will be added in the near future.

## Quickstart
For a quick demonstration of the software;
- Run main.py from your command line / terminal.
- Enter 'y' when the program asks you if you wish to import a structure.
- When asked about the structure filename, type in either 'crane' or 'kubusschnitt'. This will load a sample structure I have designed earlier.
- Move around with the camera and watch the dynamic behaviour of the structures.

Camera movement controls:
- WASDQE for camera rotation
- IJKLUO for camera translation
